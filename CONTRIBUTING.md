## 🚀 Quick Start — Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. 🌟 Star the Repository

Show your support by starring ⭐ the repo. It motivates contributors!

### 2. 🍴 Fork the Repository

Click on the **Fork** button in the top-right corner of this repository.

### 3. 📥 Clone Your Fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Dev-Elevate.git
cd Dev-Elevate
````

### 4. 📦 Install Dependencies

The project consists of two parts — **Client (Frontend)** and **Server (Backend)**.

**Frontend Setup (React + Vite):**

```bash
cd DevElevate/Client
npm install
```

**Backend Setup (Node.js + Express):**

```bash
cd DevElevate/Server
npm install
```

---

### 5. ⚙️ Run in Development Mode

Run both client and server in separate terminals.

**Backend:**

```bash
cd DevElevate/Server
node index.js
```

**Frontend:**

```bash
cd DevElevate/Client
npm run dev
```

💡 The app usually runs at:

* Frontend → `http://localhost:5173`
* Backend → `http://localhost:5000` (or as defined in `.env`)

---

### 6. 🌍 Environment Configuration (Optional)

If needed, configure your `.env` file:

```bash
cd DevElevate/Server
cp .env.sample .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your database keys, tokens, etc.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT WARNING — Before You Push!

> 💡 **Always ensure you’re on the correct branch before committing or pushing code.**

### 🔴 Commands to Follow:

```bash
git checkout <branch-name>       # 🔁 Switch to your assigned branch
git pull origin <branch-name>    # ⬇️ Pull latest updates
git add .                        # ➕ Stage your changes
git commit -m "✨ Your clear message here"  # 💬 Commit with clarity
git push origin <branch-name>    # 🚀 Push safely
```

🧠 **Tip:** Always double-check the branch name before pushing — it saves everyone from messy merge conflicts! ⚡

---

## 🧭 Syncing Your Fork with the Upstream Repo

To stay updated with the latest main branch:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/abhisek2004/Dev-Elevate.git
git pull upstream main
git push origin main
```

---

## 🌿 Branch & Commit Rules

* ✅ Use **meaningful commit messages** (e.g., `fix: UI glitch in dashboard cards`)
* ✅ Keep changes small and focused
* ✅ Run your code before submitting PR
* ✅ Avoid committing node_modules or build files

---

## 🔧 Pull Request (PR) Process

1. Fork → Clone → Work on changes
2. Commit using meaningful messages
3. Push changes to your branch
4. Create a **Pull Request to the `main` branch** of [DevElevate](https://github.com/abhisek2004/Dev-Elevate)
5. Add proper description, screenshots (if UI), and related issue numbers (`Closes #issue_no`)

> 🧩 PRs without proper descriptions may be delayed for review.
